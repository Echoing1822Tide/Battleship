A polished, fully playable Battleship game built with .NET MAUI and a C# game core.

## Highlights
- Manual fleet placement (tap-to-place + rotate).
- Turn-based player vs CPU combat.
- Smart CPU hunt/target strategy after hits.
- Ship image overlays with sunk/reveal animations.
- End-game enemy fleet reveal.
- Coordinate labels (`A-J` and `1-10`) and accessibility hints.
- Persistent stats:
  - Wins, losses, draws
  - Total turns, shots, hit rate
  - Current-game summary + last-game summary
- Unit tests and GitHub Actions CI.

## Tech Stack
- .NET 10
- .NET MAUI (Windows target currently configured)
- C# game engine in `Battleship.GameCore`
- xUnit test project in `BattleshipMaui.Tests`

## Project Structure
- `Battleship.GameCore/`: game-domain logic (`GameBoard`, ships, attacks, results).
- `ViewModels/`: gameplay state, turn loop, placement, AI, stats persistence.
- `Behaviors/`: UI animation behavior for ship reveal/sunk effects.
- `MainPage.xaml`: full game UI (boards, overlays, controls, stats panel).
- `BattleshipMaui.Tests/`: unit tests for game board, AI targeting, and view model flow.

## Run Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Visual Studio 2022+ with MAUI workload installed.
3. Build and run:
   - Startup project: `BattleshipMaui`
   - Target: Windows

CLI alternative:
```powershell
dotnet build BattleshipMaui.sln
dotnet run --project BattleshipMaui.csproj
```

## Gameplay
1. Press `New Game`.
2. Place all ships on `Your Fleet`:
   - Select ship card.
   - Use `Orientation` to rotate.
   - Tap board cells to place.
3. Fire on `Enemy Waters` by tapping a cell.
4. Alternate turns with CPU until one fleet is sunk.
5. At game-over:
   - Result is shown.
   - Enemy fleet is revealed.
   - Stats are updated and saved.

## Controls
- `New Game`: reset boards and begin placement.
- `Reset Stats`: clear saved cumulative stats.
- `Rotate`: switch ship placement orientation.

## Testing
Run full local suite:
```powershell
dotnet test BattleshipMaui.sln
```

Run the CI core subset (exactly 9 tests):
```powershell
dotnet test BattleshipMaui.Tests/BattleshipMaui.Tests.csproj --filter "Category=Core9"
```

## CI
GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Triggers on every push and PR.
- Runs the 9 tagged core tests (`Category=Core9`) on Windows.
